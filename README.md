<h2 align="center">Magic-C Compiler</h2> 

A compiler for a statically & strongly typed, C-like programming language.
This is a research project designed to explore all aspects of compiler design.

NOTE: This project is a WIP and unstable.

Magic-C is not a subset nor a superset of C, but is heavily influenced by C.

## Building

Building requires [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) as well as GCC and libc.
